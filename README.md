#BioData

A R/R6 project to store biological data. One Matrix containing numeric data will 
be accompanied by one sample and one annotation data.frame that contain mainly factors 
that describe both the column dimension (samples) as the row dimension (genes/features).

This package is meant to be a base package for any kind of biological data.

To install it I recommend using R::devtools:

library(devtools)

install_git('https://github.com/stela2502/BioData.git')
