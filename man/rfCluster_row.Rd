\description{
This fucntion uses the RFclust.SGE to create fandomForest based unsupervised clusters on a subset of the data.

Default is on 200 cells using all (provided) genes with 500 forests and 500 trees per forest for 5 repetitions.

You are asked to give a k numer of expected clusters (better too many than too little), classifies the total

data using the 5 different unsupervised runs and all cluster ids from these runs are merged into the final cluster id.

This <summaryCol> will be part of the return objects samples table, together with a <usefulCol> where

all clusters with less than 10 cells have been merged into the 'gr. 0'.

The final results will be reported as new columns in the samples table containing the 'name'
}
